        <h3>Project description</h3>

        <p class="proj-des-p">
            In day today life  the utilization of power turns  to be necessary  for each work .The power delivered in this paper will not  contaminate the  surroundings  and it  is also will  not to rely  upon the climate conditions. The paper proposes a novel technique for the creation of power utilizing piezoelectric sensors kept along the footpaths which can ready to charge the battery and ready to supply the force at whatever time of our prerequisite. The footstep power generation technique through piezoelectric sensors produces electrical force by changing mechanical energy of the development of individuals on the floor to electrical energy. The benefits of piezoelectric force generation framework is that it is sheltered and secure to utilize, it doesn't make any issue or distress for the general population strolling through footpath, and it is absolutely chance free strategy. Footstep power generation technique has mechanical part and in addition electrical part, however the electrical and mechanical losses are negligible. This framework additionally has the ability to store the electrical force away battery. The power produced by this technique can be utilized for helping up the road lights, additionally for activity reason, sign boards of streets. At long last the force which will be abandoned can be given to national grid for power reason.
<br>
Piezoelectric sensors work on the principle of the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric originates from the Greek word piezein, which literally means to squeeze or press. As the latter suggests, we are squeezing quartz crystals to make an electric voltage. Hence, piezoelectric sensors work by applying mechanical energy to a crystal in the following steps:
<ul>
<li>	A piezoelectric crystal is placed between two metal plates that are in a perfect balance (even if theyâ€™re not symmetrically arranged) and does not conduct an electric current. </li>
<li>	Metal plates apply Mechanical force or stress to the material. Electric charges forced within the crystal are out of balance. Excess negative and positive charges appear on opposite sides of the crystal face.</li>
<li>	The metal plate collects these charges and produces a voltage that sends an electrical current through a circuit. This transforms to piezoelectricity.</li>
</ul>
Hence By Using This Principle We Will Generate Electricity By Applying pressure.

"Renewable" assets of vitality, for example, Solar Cell Panel, Wind Energy can likewise be utilized to collect power. However these sources are constrained to a specific region for eg. we can say that SOLAR ENERGY can be utilized just at the spot where the sun focus is entirely great and continuous. Wind Energy can fundamentally be utilized as a part of the seaside territory's the place the wind pace and accessibility [1] is all the time present. Aside from all there human movements such as nonstop driving of the hand wrenches and little generators can be additionally used to deliver power however all these wonder of producing power requires a consistent human exertion and checking.

        <h3>Future Scope</h3>

        <p class="proj-des-p">
           <h4> 1. Houses :</h4> We Can Install This sensors Circuit in the staircase of our home to generate electricity and it can power fans and light . similarly we can install them in the tiles to generate electricity and it can power fans and light. <br>
           <h4>2. Schools :</h4> In schools the Children Climb the stairs and move up and down We Can Install This sensors Circuit in the staircase of School to generate electricity and it can power fans and light it can save our electricity bills. Also In corridors of schools this can be helpful <br>
            <h4>3. Offices:</h4> nowadays Offices Consumes Lots Of Energy So we Can install This Setup in the Stairs Corridors Tiles etc. to Save Electricity <br>  
                <h4>4. Industries:</h4> nowadays Industries Consumes Lots Of Energy So we Can install This Setup in the Stairs Corridors Tiles etc. to Save Electricity  <br> 
                    <h4>5. Road and Footpath:</h4> Every Day Many People Walk on the footpath many cars pass by the roads applying lots of pressure on the ground we can use this technology to generate huge amount of energy every day also we can install them on the speed breakers <br>
                        <h4>6. Jogging tracks / parks:</h4> Every Day Many People Run on the jogging Tracks many applying lots of pressure on the ground we can use this technology to generate energy every day. <br>
